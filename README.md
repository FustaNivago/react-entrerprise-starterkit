The skeleton for enterprise projects, modules architecture approach

## How do I start my React enterprise application?
**What frameworks, libraries should I use and what architecture to choose?** <br/>
Well, React doesn’t force you to use predefined patterns\frameworks or libraries. Unlike Angular, ReactJS is not a framework and you have pretty much a lot of freedom here, which is not always good.<br/>
According to the [official documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) it is better to start with one of the frameworks:

* **Next.js**: offers SSR and therefore good performance and SEO
* **Remix**: full stack framework with nested routing, is a good choice - it combines frontend and backend into a single application. You don’t need a dedicated backend team as the whole application leverages the same technologies.
* **Gatsby**: SEO first framework, reach plugin ecosystem ideally for CMS systems.

Each framework listed above has pros and cons, but probably none of them meets your requirements. Should you start with scratch? Not really, let's go through all the steps and build a boilerplate for an enterprise application.
